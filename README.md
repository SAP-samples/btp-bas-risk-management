# Accelerate Development of SAP S/4 HANA Extension Applications with SAP Business Application Studio

> Note: The content of this GitHub repository has been created as source for the SAP Discovery Center Mission [Accelerate Development of SAP S/4HANA Extension Applications with SAP Business Application Studio](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/protected/index.html#/missiondetail/3784/3825/). So we recommend using directly the mission in the SAP Discovery Center.

## Description

The main intend of this scenario is to build a low-code application to display Business Partner data from an SAP S/4HANA on-premise system.

This application showcases:
- Building application on SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP) using SAP Business Application Studio visual tools
- Deploying the application on SAP BTP Cloud Foundry environment
- Connectivity to SAP S/4HANA using SAP Connectivity service

## Business Scenario

In this mission, a *Food Delivery Platform* works with several *Vendors* to deliver food to their customers. For each *Vendor*, the risk is calculated depending on various aspects, for example, their solvency. A *Risk Manager* is responsible for the risk assessment and mitigation.

The *Food Delivery Platform* implements the application as an SAP S/4HANA extension on SAP BTP. This application is developed with the help of the visual tools of SAP Business Application Studio.

## Solution Architecture

![Solution diagram](./documentation/discover/business-story/images/SolutionDiagramBAS.png)

The Risk Management application is developed using the SAP Business Application Studio visual tools and runs on the SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment. It consumes platform services like SAP HANA Cloud, SAP Build Work Zone, standard edition service and Connectivity. The Business Partner Validation Application uses SAP S/4HANA OData API's to read additional Business Partner Data from the SAP S/4HANA system. The application is then displayed using the SAP Build Work Zone, standard edition service.
