# Learn How to Use Missions and Project Boards in SAP Discovery Center

Missions include best practices and step-by-step guidance for implementing business use cases, with well-established support from the community and mission experts, free of cost.

Once you start a mission, you create your own instance of this mission. This allows you to adapt and customize the content according to your specific needs, to invite your team members to work on the whole mission or on specific steps, and to interact with the mission coaches directly. See [Getting Started with Discovery Center Missions](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/protected/index.html#/missiondetail/3918/3389/) for more details.


Every mission contains a project board that allows you to:
1. Get an overview of all the potential deliverables for a mission, whether it is onboarding or implementation.
2. View fully customizable tasks that are listed as cards and categorized into phases (columns).
    1. We realize that each of your mission can be unique, this board supports that.
    2. Collaborate with your coaches.


Once you learn who your coaches are, you can contact them by adding a comment in the task by tagging them @Sarah Kraemer and they will receive a direct message and should respond to you within a short period of time (depending on their working time zone).

1. Align your mission with the experts.
    1. Both you and your coaches will keep track of the progress by completing each task.
    2. When working on one task Pin (the current) Card.
    3. Once a task is completed Mark (the card) as completed.
2. Keep mission assets all in one place.
